                <p class ="intro_paragraph"> My trip to Ancorage Alaska was a trip of a lifetime. I will show key highlights of the trip. I went on the trip with two friend Tim and Evan. We had to fly to Anchorage and then take a plane out to main destination of Port Alsworth. It was the first time in  Alaska for all three of us. 
                <p class ="intro_paragraph"> Port Alsworth is located 100 miles south-west of Ancorage. It is located on Lake Clark which is the largest lake in the state. The water is crystal clear. It has 150 year round residents. It was founded in 1950 by a missionary and busch pilot. Port Asworth is only reachable by plane and boat during the summer. The climate is continental subarctic. </p>

                    <h2 id="trip_segments">Leaving Anchorage</h2>
                    <p>The first adventure of the trip was the flight to Port Alsworth. The plane was a tiny twin engine aircraft. We had to have the weight of our bags be exact. When packing for the trip we had to plan for this flight. </p>

                        <p>There were many float planes. There was a tiny gravel landing strip as well. To fly to Port Alsworth you have to travel through Lake Clark Pass. It is can be very dangerous as the weather can change quickly and fog can disorient the pilot.</p>

                        <h2 id="trip_segments"> Camping at Kijik Lake</h2>
                        <p>We had an eleven mile hike to Kikik Lake. It was a tough hike as there was no trails which made you have to watch each step carefully. It was beautiful as were able to pass through multiple biomes. I especially enjoyed walking through the frozen tundra. </p>

                        <h2 id="trip_segments"> Return to civilization </h2>
                            <p>After the trip we had fours days in Anchorage. We did not have any plans besides staying at this youth hostel. The only room we could reserve was one with multiple roomates. We ended up biking around town, fishing and exploring the town.   </p>
